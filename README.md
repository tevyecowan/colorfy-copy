# Colorfy

Colorfy is an internal tool being developed for use by Theme support team members.
Colorfy is an extension that allows for custom code colours for the Shopify code editor. It has three presets and an option to reset the colours back to the default colours. When Darkmode is enabled it will auto load the editor in dark mode including changing the Sidebar to a Darkmode. Additionally I added a keyboard command for that will toggle fullscreen with "MacCtrl + Shift + F".
